For the tool to be able to process daemons, it requires that you put atleast one altcoin-daemon in the /daemons folder.

You can add any daemon you like, and if you can't find a daemon you can try with the qt-wallet.exe.<br>
(Note: some coins come with a few external dll's they make use of. They simply won't work correctly without those external dll's).

Once there are daemons to process, they will appear in the "Available Daemons" list. <br>
You can now click "START EXTRACTION" to start the tool.
